class Lesson(BaseModel):

    Represents a single lesson within a course.

    Workflow:
    1. DocumentProcessor parses course document header (title, instructor, link)
    2. Course object created with empty lessons list
    3. Lessons added as document is processed
    4. Course stored in VectorStore.course_catalog for semantic matching

    3. Chunks stored in VectorStore.course_content collection
    4. Embeddings generated via sentence-transformers
    5. Used for semantic search during RAG queries

    Chunking strategy:
    - Sentence-based splitting (preserves semantic meaning)
    - ~800 characters per chunk with 100 char overlap
    - First chunk of lesson includes "Lesson N content:" prefix for context

class Source(BaseModel):

    Represents a source citation with optional clickable link.

    Workflow:
    1. CourseSearchTool retrieves lesson links from ChromaDB
    2. Each source includes text (display name), optional URL, and index

    4. Frontend renders inline citations with tooltips showing full source
